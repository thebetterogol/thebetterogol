- 👋 Hi, I’m @thebetterogol (ogol are my initials and thus a nickname I've gone by throughout my life, but you can call me Olivia! (full name Olivia Lease)
- 👀 I’m interested in neuroscience and public health, specifically how I can use math to analyze mental health in historically underserved communities. As a reconnecting Native, I care lots about open source and accessibility in (compsci) education.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build neural networks from scratch! I want to work more in machine learning and specifically its intersections in neuroscience.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on classifying algorithms, Napari clustering techniques, and DeepLabCut analysis algorithms.
- 📫 How to reach me -- email is best! I respond the most to olivia.lease@columbia.edu
